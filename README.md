# Solicount
A (German) tool for Arduino for counting attendances. Increasing / decreasing works via two buttons. The result is displayed on a sainsmart LCD2004.
The two button are connected to the ports 2 and 3, the LCD to the ports A4 and A5 (and GND and 5V). As board an Arduino UNO is used, but any other should do as well.

Have fun!
